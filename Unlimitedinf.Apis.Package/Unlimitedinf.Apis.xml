    <Description>
Client-side libraries to work with the apis made available on https://unlimitedinf-apis.azurewebsites.net/

There is one DLL available defining the contracts used to communicate with the server as well as an EXE in the tools folder that wraps it for commandline interactions.
The EXE can also be used as a reference because it is well separated into client-side libraries and runnable infrastructure.
